    "This session _(Advanced AI: Using Large Language Models for Data Analysis)_ is designed to introduce basic programming skills. The focus is on practical applications of coding in healthcare settings, with the aim of getting you comfortable with the basics; we hope you can apply these skills to automate the boring things in your life,  maybe use some of this in a research project, and overall just feel less intimidated by the idea. \n",

    "This is a private \"Jupyter notebook\" hosted on one of the AIM lab comupters. Jupyter notebooks are a mixture of a normal document, like Microsoft Word, mixed in with usable programming areas. This makes it really easy to follow along with someone elses code or do a tutorial. The most commonly-used noteboks these days is [Google Colab](https://colab.google.com). Google offers a free notebook to every Google account, where you can run your own scripts without downloading anything! This website, the AIM Lab Cloud, is similar to Google collab, except that it is private and pre-loaded with some data for today's exercise. \n"
